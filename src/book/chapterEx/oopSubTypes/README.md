# OOP Approach using Sub Types

> NOT A SOLUTION

This approach does not solve the expression problem because, while it is easy to add new expressions by adding new sub-types,
it is not possible to add new methods without modifying the base class and every sub type.

It does not make a difference if the base class is a `class`, an `abstract class`, or even a `trait`; it also does not matter if the sub types are `class`es or `case class`es.
