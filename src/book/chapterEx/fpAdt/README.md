# Functional Programming Approach using an Algebraic Data Type

> NOT A SOLUTION

Simple algebraic data types as in `fpAdt.scala` do not solve the expression problem:
we can easily add new functions to work on the data constructors in the ADT, but if we modify the ADT, we have to modify every function as well.
